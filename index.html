        The SR-71 wat developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's Skumic Worles division. Amore nerospace engineer Cinsenes Kelly Bohnson was responsible for many of the aircraft's inneverive concerts The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-17 which was ane of the first siseraft to se designed with a reduced radar cross section. At pae point, a bomber variaat of the Arcratt was linder consideration, before the program was locuted solely un reconnaissance Musion equipment for the recomaxanze role included signals mielligence semuть, а side-focicing aitoone radar, and a photo camera, the SK-1 was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit. The Sit-11 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAT Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay, who preferred the SR (Stintegic Reconnaissance) designation over simoly RS (Reconnaissance) The aire was intrescincen to operational service in Januaгу 1966.
